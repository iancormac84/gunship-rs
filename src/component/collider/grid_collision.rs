//! A grid-based broadphase collision system. The default collision system for Gunship.
//!
//! The grid collision system places collision volumes in a uniform grid and builds the candidate
//! collision list from the pairs of entities that share a grid cell. If two entities never overlap
//! in any cell then it is impossible for them to be colliding and no further testing between the
//! is necessary. The grid collision system is a good general purpose system with reasonable
//! performance characteristics, though is likely not optimal in most cases under heavy load.
//!
//! Algorithm
//! =========
//!
//! Conceptually the grid collision system works by dividing space into a uniform grid of cells.
//! Collision volumes are placed into all cells which they may overlap (determined using the
//! volume's AABB), and if there are other colliders in those cells then they are added to the list
//! of candidate collisions that gets sent to narrowphase processing.
//!
//! For this implementation the grid is represented by a `HashTable<GridCell, Vec<*const BoundVolume>>`,
//! where the key is the coordinates of the grid and the value is a list of the collision volumes
//! that have been placed into that cell.
//!
//! As psuedocode the algorithm goes as follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! for volume in collision_volumes {
//!     for cell in volume.aabb {
//!         for other_volume in cell {
//!             candidate_collisions.push(volume, other_volume);
//!         }
//!
//!         cell.push(volume);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It's important to note that any given volume may overlap multiple cells. If that's the case it
//! will be inserted into each cell it overlaps, and other volumes may be listed as a candidate
//! collision partner multiple times. These duplicate candidate collisions are culled out by the
//! narrowphase pass and do not result in redundant collision tests.
//!
//! Filling Grid Cells
//! ==================
//!
//! The collision grid is defined by the size of the grid cells and the center point of the grid.
//! Grid cells are axis aligned and uniform in size along X, Y, and Z, so the size of grid cells
//! is described with a single `f32`. The grid center is offset from the world origin in order to
//! more evenly subdivide the space for parallel collision processing (discussed below).
//!
//! The coordinate of a grid cell represents its minimum point, so the grid cell `(0, 0, 0)` covers
//! the space from `grid_center` to `grid_center + cell_size * (1, 1, 1)`. In general any grid cell
//! `<x, y, z>` covers the space from `grid_center + <x, y, z> * cell_size` to `grid_center +
//! <x + 1, y + 1, z + 1> * cell_size`.
//!
//! In order to minimize the number of grid cells that any given collision volume overlaps the cell
//! size is dynamically updated to be as long as the longest axis of any volume's AABB. This
//! guarantees that no matter how volumes are positioned or oriented in space no volume can ever
//! be placed in more than 8 grid cells on a given frame. This helps to minimize the number of
//! grid lookups needed to perform the broadphase pass at the cost of potentially more candidate
//! collisions that need to be processed in narrowphase.
//!
//! Parallel Collision processing
//! ============================
//!
//! The grid collision system utilizes a configurable number of worker threads in order to speed up
//! collision processing. This is done by subdividing the collision region into half-spaces and
//! assigning those work regions to each worker thread. Worker threads then process all collision
//! volumes but ignore any that do not intersect its work region. Each worker maintains its own
//! grid and builds its own list of candidate collisions. It then runs its own narrowphase pass on
//! its candidate collisions and returns the resulting list of confirmed collisions to the master
//! thread. This has dual benefits:
//!
//! - Collisions (both broadphase and narrowphase) are processed in parallel. This is naturally
//!   faster than serial processing as the grid-based processing and narrowphase processsing both
//!   lend themselves well to being done in parallel since there are no dependencies or
//!   synchronization between workers running in parallel.
//! - The grid collision processing also benefits from subdividing the work region even when not
//!   processing the regions in parallel. This is because grid lookup times increase as there are
//!   more elements in the hash grid, so using separate grids reduces the number of colliders in
//!   each hash grid, which improves lookup time and speeds up each worker thread further.
//!
//! Worker threads are maintained in a thread pool and kept running between frames to avoid the
//! overhead of repeatedly creating and destroying threads. The synchronization overhead to give
//! each worker thread its work unit each frame is low (< 0.1ms). The main thread has to perform
//! some limited processing on the collision lists delivered by each worker thread since collision
//! pairs that overlap the boundaries between work units will be detected by both or all of those
//! workers, however this benefits somewhat from being done in parallel as well, helping to keep
//! overhead low.
