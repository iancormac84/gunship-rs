// Using `RawVec<T>`, could be replaced.
#![feature(alloc)]
// Almost certainly going to be stabilized as-is, unlikely to break anything.
#![feature(const_fn)]
// The scheduler puts a `Condvar` and `Mutex` into some statics.
#![feature(drop_types_in_const)]
// Used by the scheduler for handling work. We might be able to remove that with some unsafe magic,
// but even then being able to box a `FnOnce()` is valuable, so this is unlikely to go away.
#![feature(fnbox)]
// Useful when sending raw pointers between threads, could be replaced.
