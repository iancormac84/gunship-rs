//! The main scheduler logic.
//!
//! The scheduler is implemented as a singleton in order to make it easy for code anywhere in the
//! project to make use of async functionality. The actual scheduler instance is not publicly
//! accessible, instead we use various standalone functions like `start()` and `wait_for()` to
//! safely manage access to the scheduler.
//!
//! # Scheduling Work
//!
//! Use `scheduler::start()` to run some work asynchronously, getting an `Async<T>` representing the
//! result of the work. Use `Async::await()` to suspend the current fiber until the work completes
//! and get the result. By default, dropping an `Async<T>` will suspend the current fiber until
//! the work finishes, but you can use `Async::forget()` to ignore the result without blocking.
//!
//! # Sharing Data Between Work
//!
//! Unlike with `std::thread::spawn()`, it's possible for work started with `scheduler::start()`
//! to borrow data from the caller:
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ```
