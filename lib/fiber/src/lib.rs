//! A libray for creating and managing fibers in a cross-platform manner.
//!
//! Fibers are threads that must be manually scheduled by the client application, as opposed to
//! threads which are automatically managed and scheduled by the OS. Each fiber has its own stack
//! space and can be yield its time on the system thread to another fiber at any point during
//! execution. This allows for different forms of concurrency that can't be supported with
//! normal system threads.
//!
//! This library is meant to be the base for a fiber-pool system, in which a fixed number of worker
//! fibers are created and used to asynchronously complete units of work.
//!
//! # Fibers and Threads
//!
//! Fibers are run on top of system threads, with one fiber running on a thread at a time. Once
//! a fiber has been suspended it can be resumed on any thread (i.e the same thread it was
//! previously on or any other thread). You don't have to have multiple threads to use fibers,
//! but if only using a single thread fibers won't run in parallel. As such, it's generally best
//! to use fibers in combination with a pool of worker threads.
//!
//! Being able to move a fiber between threads also has implications for the thread-safety of
//! your code. There are a number of system-primitives that don't take well to moving between
//! threads, and so you must be careful when you resume fibers. Notably, [`Mutex`][mutex]
//!
//! # Unsafety
//!
//! Unlike any other function in Rust, fiber procs can be suspended on one thread and resumed
//! on another, pulling any stack-owned data along with it. That means that it's possible to
//! create a `!Send` type, suspend the fiber, and resume the fiber on another thread,
//! violating the `!Send` nature of the type. As such, it's unsafe to ever call `Fiber::resume()`
//! while a `!Send` type is alive and in scope.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic usage:
//!
//! ```
//! use fiber::Fiber;
//!
//! // Function to be run by the fiber. Return type must be `!`, this indicates that it will never
//! // return. This is necessary because fibers cannot be destroyed on some platforms.
//! fn fiber_proc(suspended: Fiber) -> ! {
//!     println!("Suspended fiber: {:?}", suspended);
//!     unsafe { suspended.resume(); }
//!
//!     panic!("Uh-oh, shouldn't have resumed this fiber again");
//! }
//!
//! let fiber = Fiber::new(1024, fiber_proc);
//! let fiber_id = fiber.id();
//!
//! let prev = unsafe { fiber.resume() };
//! assert_eq!(fiber_id, prev.id());
//! ```
